## Challenges Encountered & Solutions

### 1. **Foreign Key Constraint Issue**
**Challenge:** Account deletion failed due to phantom UserProfile table constraint.
**Solution:** Implemented try-catch error handling with manual cleanup of related records before user deletion.

### 2. **Progress Calculation Logic**
**Challenge:** Ensuring progress bars update automatically when tasks are completed.
**Solution:** Implemented custom save methods in Task model to trigger parent (Skill/Project) progress recalculation.

### 3. **Mobile Responsive Navigation**
**Challenge:** Creating a professional mobile navigation without CSS frameworks.
**Solution:** Built custom hamburger menu with CSS transforms and JavaScript toggle functionality.

### 4. **Performance & Code Organization**
**Challenge:** CSS duplication, overly specific selectors, and no systematic approach to styling.
**Solution:** Organized CSS with proper specificity hierarchy, eliminated duplication, and implemented maintainable code structure.

### 5. **Typography Hierarchy Inconsistency**
**Challenge:** Inconsistent font sizes, weights, and poor visual hierarchy across different pages and components.
**Solution:** Established consistent typography scale with proper heading hierarchy (h1: 2.5rem, h2: 2rem, etc.) and standardized font weights.
